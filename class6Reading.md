## In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

For my I realized how important is it because of I was able to learn new techniques and approaches that I wouldnt of found out about other wise and I also seen how awesome it was to be able to have one person do research while the other was typing out code. We always had the foot on the gas while the other got something else set up.

## How does pair programming work?

USually you will have atleast two people ( a driver and a navigator). The driver is the person working the keyboard.. they are usually just typing what is being asked of them, yes they do offer insight and input if needed but they are focused on writting and making sure their or no syntax errors. The other side of the coin is the navigator: this person is usually telling the driver what to write, They are focused on the logic and the overall big picture of the project.

## Things I want to know more about
