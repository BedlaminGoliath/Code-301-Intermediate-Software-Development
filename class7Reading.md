From the article I would say that creating an environment where everyone in my group (or atleast anyone that i am working with would feel, heard and know that we are here to collaborate). It seems that even having alot in common didnt really help the overall work experience. The enviroment where everyone feels heard and the fact that there is this base line connection seems to be a very important factor when it comes to PP.

## Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy wrote the first serves, these are what sent documents through the internet. Beyond doing that he also did alot of research explaining why the web does what it does.

## Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Because at the time the http protocol was made being able to talk to every machine wasnt on the menu, the only thing was they wanted to talk to a very select amount of machines. So all the machines didnt have the met standard to be able to talk to every other machine in the world. So it wasnt common for machine to be able tp "redirect".

## What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

This is the concept of "applying verbs to nouns". This is a set groups of verbs that an be applied to different types of nouns, various "resources".

## What does a GET do?

GET retreives info from the web, no matter what the format this protocol is sent to grab the different pieces of data from the web.

## What does a POST do?

This is used if one system needs to add more data to another system.

## What does PUT do?
